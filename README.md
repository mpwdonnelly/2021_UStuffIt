# UStuffIt
Capstone Project
<h2>UStuffIt</h2>
<p>A project done in support of our class "Software Development Capstone" at CVTC in late 2021</p>
<h4>The Concept</h4>
<p>People often own a lot of stuff, and those who wish to be careful about how they take care of that stuff
  need to keep track of some basic aspects of their things: What they are, where they are, what condition they
  are in, how much they are worth, what their plans are for the stuff, etc. UStuffIt is designed to be a way that
  stuff-owners can track that stuff and keep everything they might need to know about that stuff at a glance, 
  available on any digital device that can host a standard browser.</p>
  <h4>The Design</h4>
  <p>Designed as a single-page application, the user will be able to create, read, update, and delete records for 
  items in their collection of stuff, whichever portion of it they care to record and track. For our stack we have
  incorporated Vue.js for the front end, with Eclipse/Node running interactions with a Postgres DB on the backend.
  The UI will dynamically reconfigure depending on the device the user is accessing their records on.</p>
