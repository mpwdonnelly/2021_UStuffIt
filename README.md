# UStuffIt
Capstone Project
<h2>UStuffIt</h2>
<p>A project done in support of our class "Software Development Capstone" at CVTC in late 2021</p>
<h4>The Concept</h4>
<p>People often own a lot of stuff, and those who wish to be careful about how they take care of that stuff
  need to keep track of some basic aspects of their things: What they are, where they are, what condition they
  are in, how much they are worth, what their plans are for the stuff, etc. UStuffIt is designed to be a way that
  stuff-owners can track that stuff and keep everything they might need to know about that stuff at a glance, 
  available on any digital device that can host a standard browser.</p>
